# CryptoClustering Challenge

## In this challenge I applied my understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically I examined changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.
